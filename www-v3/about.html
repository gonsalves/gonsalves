          <p>Pixelogue was started in 2005 by <strong>Rahul Gonsalves</strong> to help organisations and small businesses develop coherent web strategies and leverage emerging technologies to better engage with the wider public.</p>
          
          <p>Rahul has been building sites that have ranged in size and complexity from small portfolio websites to larger dynamic sites managed by multiple authors. He is interested, specifically, in exploring the emerging area of electronic accessibility: making electronic systems and information accessible to people with disabilities and has presented several papers on the subject. He has advised the Ministry of IT and Communication, C-DAC, NIXI and private sector organisations like Wipro, Infosys and IBM on the adoption of electronic accessibility standards.</p>
