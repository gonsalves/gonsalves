<div class="aboutText">
<p>Welcome to Gonsalves Design, my website consultancy online. I am Rahul Gonsalves, and I enjoy building websites that conform to web standards, are accessible to everyone and are just plain ol' pretty.</p>

<h2>Accessible</h2>
<p>The internet is one of the most empowering mediums, as it provides a (more or less) democratic space for everyone. However, people with disabilities (visual and/or motor) often find badly designed websites difficult to navigate. I aim to remove the _technical_ barriers that prevent disabled people from using websites, helping them have a far more pleasant experience online.</p>

<h2>Standards Compliant</h2>
<p>Web standards are standards that exist for the underlying code (the xHTML and CSS, if you want to get geeky) that drives websites. Websites which conform to these standards will work as intended, load quickly and display consistently.</p>

<h2>Just Beautiful (tm pending).</h2>

<p>In another life, I am a student; I am currently studying towards a Bachelors degree in Industrial Relations, Economics and Sociology at St. Joseph's College, Bangalore.</p>
